title: Welcome to My Blog

Hi,

I am Orkhan, Front-End Engineer a.k.a JavaScript Developer with nearly 3 years of experience with development of front-end and full stack web applications using JavaScript and JS related technologies. I am interested in math, computer science and everything related to programming, math and algorithms.

I love (but sometimes having difficulty with) solving programming problems and learning topics like Theory of Computation, Compiler Theory, Algorithms and Data Structures.

Apart from JavaScript, I have developed some middle sized, small and large project using Java (Servlets, JSP, little Spring Boot) and PHP (Classic, Laravel). I am willing to learn C++ in order to contribute Google's V8 engine and take a look at other engines such as JavaScriptCore and SpiderMonkey. I can work with React, Redux, Jest, Enzyme, Angular2+, RxJS, TypeScript and Laravel.

Here is my welcome message to you with JavaScript's revealing module pattern:

```javascript
var Blog = (function() {
  return {
    init: function initBlog() {
      console.log("Let's get started! :)");
    }
  };
})();

Blog.init();
```
